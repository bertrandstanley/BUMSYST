#Budget Managment System (BUMSYST)

## Description


Our team created this web app to help families and households manage their money, and track spending habits. We are all working people, and sometimes money management is hard to keep track of. This website helps solve that problem. By accurately calculating your income and neatly displaying all of your documented spending you are able to more easily track your habits, and perhaps where you could improve financially in the future.
